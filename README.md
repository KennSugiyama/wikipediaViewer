# [Wikipedia Viewer FreeCodeCamp Project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-wikipedia-viewer)

## Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/wGqEga/.

Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

[X] User Story: I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.

[X] User Story: I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.
